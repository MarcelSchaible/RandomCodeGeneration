Demonstrator for a simple random code generation with ANTLR.
The generation is purely based on the grammar.

* Build

Run the build script in the project root directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./build.sh
#+END_SRC


* Test

In the out directory run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
java -cp /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar:.  Main
#+END_SRC

The program produces with every run a different generated code purely based on the grammar "expr.g4"
